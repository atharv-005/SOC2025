# On-Chain Crowdfunding Platform

## Overview

This is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built as part of the Seasons of Code program. It allows users to create and contribute to fundraising campaigns directly on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.

## Features

- Create fundraising campaigns
- Contribute Ether to active campaigns
- Campaign creators can withdraw funds after successful completion
- Deadline and goal tracking

## What I Learned

- Basics of blockchain and how decentralized ledgers work
- Cryptography concepts like hashing, digital signatures, and key-pair encryption
- How decentralized applications (dApps) operate
- Writing and deploying smart contracts using Solidity
- Using concepts like:
  - State variables, structs, mappings
  - Constructors and modifiers
  - Payable functions
  - Global variables like `msg.sender`, `msg.value`, `block.timestamp`

## Tech Stack

- Solidity
- Ethereum
- Remix IDE

## Future Improvements

- Add a frontend interface using Web3.js or Ethers.js
- Improve campaign discovery and UI
- Add verification for campaign legitimacy
